    "The visual novel [Hate Plus](https://store.steampowered.com/app/239700/Hate_Plus/) takes place in the year 4989. An important theme of the story (simplifying quite a bit here) is Korean culture, and in-game the new year occurs on February 10 (as evidenced by [this screenshot](https://lparchive.org/Hate-Plus/Update%2031/3-525.jpg) and the one below).\n",

Chinese new year [typically occurs during the second or third new moon after the winter solstice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_New_Year) so it turns out that this problem is strongly related to predicting the phases of the moon far into the future.\n",

    "Many online tools for looking up the date of the lunar new year don't support dates beyond a couple hundred years into the future. Moreover, multiple LLMs (even after enabling chain-of-thought (\"reasoning\") and \"deep research\" modes, and using external tools) provided different answers. For example:\n",

    "* Since the predicted datetime is 4989-02-10 21:36:32 UTC, this would be 11th of February in the time zones of most Asian countries. This potentially means that the answer provided by ChatGPT with deep research mode enabled was actually correct. It's a bit hard to tell if that was just a fluke.\n",
    "* Since this date is almost 3000 years into the future, there is some uncertainty involved. The ephemeris used (DE441) makes different assumptions than the one used for smaller timescales (DE440) so that it can support dates further away. There may be doubts about using predictions that are so far into the future - nevertheless, I believe that using these newest available tables published by NASA JPL constitutes the \"best guess\" we may currently have.
